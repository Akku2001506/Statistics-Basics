        "- 3. Symmetric Distribution (Zero Skewness) – Data is evenly distributed around the mean.\n",
        "    - Example: A perfectly normal distribution (e.g., heights of adults in a population).\n",
        "#Effect of Skewness on Data Interpretation:\n",
        " - Mean vs. Median: In skewed distributions, the mean is pulled toward the tail, while the median remains more central, making the median a better measure of central tendency.\n",
